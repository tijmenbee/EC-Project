"""
Assume an undirected graph with the set of vertices V and set of
edges E. The number of vertices |V| = n is even. The graph
bipartitioning problem is to find a partitioning of the set of vertices V
into 2 subsets A and B of equal size (|A| = |B|), such that the number of
edges between vertices of A and B is minimal.
